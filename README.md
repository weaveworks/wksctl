# Weave Kubernetes System Control - `wksctl`

`wksctl` allows simple creation of a Kubernetes cluster given a **set of IP addresses** and an **SSH key**. It can be run in a standalone environment but is best used via a [GitOps approach](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) in which cluster and machine descriptions are stored in Git and the state of the cluster tracks changes to the descriptions.

Its features include:

- simple creation of Kubernetes clusters
- manage cluster and machine descriptions using Git
- manage addons like Weave Net or Flux
- Sealed Secret integration

## Install wksctl binary

1. Download the OS specific `wksctl` release package from the [release page](https://github.com/weaveworks/wksctl/releases)
1. Unpack and add the `wksctl` binary to your path

For example:

```console
cd <download dir>
tar xfz wksctl-0.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
chmod +x wksctl
sudo mv wksctl /usr/local/bin/
```
