# WKS and Firekube

## Firekube 

[Firekube](https://github.com/weaveworks/wks-quickstart-firekube) is a project that will quickly get you up and running with `wksctl`, a git repo for [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/), and [footloose](https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose) with an [Ignite](https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) backend.  It automates several of the steps you see in the `wksctl` documentation.

For more information see the  [Firekube quickstart](https://github.com/weaveworks/wks-quickstart-firekube)
